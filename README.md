## üöÄ Overview

Computer Vision (CV) and Pattern Recognition (PR) are fields of artificial intelligence that focus on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual data. 
This repository provides hands-on projects that cover a range of fundamental and advanced techniques used in these domains.

### Key Techniques:

- **Image Classification**: Using machine learning or deep learning models to classify images.
- **Object Detection**: Identifying and locating objects in images or video frames.
- **Image Segmentation**: Dividing an image into segments to simplify or change its representation.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting key features from images for tasks like matching, recognition, and tracking.
- **Face Recognition**: Identifying or verifying individuals from digital images or videos.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Converting different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents or PDFs, into editable and searchable data.
